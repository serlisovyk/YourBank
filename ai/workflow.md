# Task Workflow

End-to-end sequence for taking a Linear task in this repo. `AGENTS.md` states the
non-negotiable rules; this file is the full flow.

## 1. Pick up the task

- Read the Linear issue (`MY-<n>`) in full, including its «Порядок» section, its
  checklists, its «Решения автора» section and its "blocked by" relations. Do not start
  a task whose blockers are not `Done`.
- Check `ai/decisions/` for anything the task would contradict — especially the ideas
  `ai/rules/scope.md` names as out. If it reverses a decision, say so before starting.
- If the scope is ambiguous or conflicts with a rule or decision record, ask **before**
  writing anything, and put every question in a plain chat message too, not only in a
  question tool: a restart of the session loses what only the tool showed.

## 2. Branch

- Branch off the latest `main`, named `my-<n>-<slug>` (e.g. `my-<n>-faq-expander`) —
  lowercase issue id, short English slug.
- Do not use Linear's `gitBranchName` as-is: it prepends a username and its slug is a
  transliteration of the Russian title. Write your own short English slug.
- Never commit task work directly on `main`.
- Several tasks at once: one `git worktree` per branch, see "Parallel work" below.

## 3. Move the task to In Progress

Set the Linear issue state to `In Progress` when work actually starts — not when it is
merely planned.

## 4. Orient

Read in this order, stopping once you have what the task needs:

1. `ai/map.md` — where things live and what the project deliberately lacks.
2. The `ai/rules/*` of the area you touch, and the decision records of what you touch
   (index in `ai/decisions/README.md`).
3. The matching skill in `ai/skills/` — `section` for anything on a page.

Do not explore the code from scratch when the map answers the question.
`ai/superpowers/` is the archive of past tasks: read only the plan or spec of the feature
you change.

## 5. Spec + plan — one commit, before code

- **Plan** — for anything touching more than one or two files, or with more than one
  reasonable approach. Say what will change and how it will be verified; cite decision
  records, do not retell them (`ai/rules/docs.md`).
- **Spec** — when the task changes observable behavior (interaction, navigation, layout
  at a breakpoint, what a screen reader hears).
- Write them under `ai/superpowers/plans/` and `ai/superpowers/specs/` as
  `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`, reusing the branch slug so spec, plan, branch, and issue pair up.
- Commit spec + plan together as a **single commit**, before any implementation commit.
- If the issue says something is to be "decided in the plan" (`решить в плане`), stop after
  the plan commit and hand the plan to the author. Continue only after approval, updating
  the plan with the author's answers.
- A trivial, single-file, single-approach change does not need a plan file — use judgment,
  don't manufacture ceremony.

## 6. Implement

- Follow the plan; commit in logical units, not one giant snapshot. Inspect `git status`
  and `git diff` before each commit.
- Every commit goes through the pre-commit hook; never bypass it with
  `--no-verify`, fix what it reports.
- Conventional Commit messages in English (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `style:`,
  `build:`, `chore:`) — specific, never `update` or `changes`.
- Use the matching skill instead of improvising a pattern that already exists.
- If reality diverges from the plan, update the plan file in the same change.

## 7. Keep docs in the same change

Only what the change made wrong, within the limits of `ai/rules/docs.md`:

- `README.md` — when what a user sees, the scripts, or the structure changed, if the repo
  has one.
- `ai/map.md` — when a page, partial, stylesheet, script, data file, or asset folder was
  added, removed, renamed, or moved.
- `ai/rules/*` or `ai/skills/*` — when the change reshaped a pattern.
- `ai/decisions/` — a new dated record when the change meets the criteria in its
  `README.md`.
- A doc that crosses its size limit is trimmed in this same change.

## 8. Verify

- The checks in `AGENTS.md` (Verification).
- Use a page change in `npm run dev`: 1920, 1440 and 390 px against the design, keyboard
  and mouse, and `prefers-reduced-motion` for anything animated. A green build does not
  prove a UI change works.
- If the built-in browser refuses `localhost`, use headless Chrome over the DevTools
  protocol: the browser check is not skipped.
- For a change that can affect the build or the deployment (build config, file moves), run
  `npm run build` and `npm run preview`; pushing the branch gives a Vercel preview. No pull
  request is needed for that.
- No automated tests exist. Do not add them, and do not report their absence as a gap.

## 9. Definition of Done gate

Walk `ai/rules/definition-of-done.md` point by point. Fix what fails before moving on.

## 10. Self-review

Run the `review` skill over the diff, then read the whole `git diff main..HEAD` line by line
against `ai/rules/style.md`, `ai/rules/oop.md`, `ai/rules/html.md` and `ai/rules/css.md`. A
subagent does both before it reports; the orchestrator reads the diff again before the author
sees the branch. Fix what you find, or state plainly why a finding is being left alone.

## 11. Author approval — required stop

Nothing is merged and nothing is marked done without the author's explicit approval.
Hand over the report (step 12) and stop — silence or a neutral reply is not a yes.
«Продолжай» ("carry on") is a neutral reply, not an approval; an approval names the
branch, and a yes to one branch does not cover the next.
Requested changes go back through steps 6–10; fold a small fix into the commit that
introduced it (`--fixup` + autosquash) rather than always adding a new commit.

## 12. Report

In Russian (it is chat, not a file):

- **what was done** — plain language, point by point, readable without opening the diff or
  the plan;
- branch (and worktree path, if any) and the commit list;
- verification output and what was checked by hand in the browser;
- self-review findings and what was done about each;
- anything deliberately left out of scope.

## 13. Merge — locally, no pull request

After approval:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git switch my-<n>-<slug>
git rebase main            # re-run the checks if the rebase brought in new commits
git switch main
git merge --ff-only my-<n>-<slug>
npm run format:check && npm run build
git push origin main
git branch -d my-<n>-<slug>
```

- After a rebase that brings in another branch's page work, check the combined result in
  the browser too: a global style change in one branch can break a block of the other.
- `main` deploys to Vercel production on the push: check the live site read-only (open it,
  fetch it) and never touch the Vercel project (decision `vercel-json-without-old-redirect`).
- History stays linear: rebase onto `main`, then fast-forward. Never force-push `main`.
- If the branch was pushed (for a preview), delete it on the remote too
  (`git push origin --delete my-<n>-<slug>`).
- Remove the worktree if one was used (`git worktree remove <path>`).
- Move the Linear issue to `Done` only once the live site shows the merge, and comment with
  the merged commit SHAs, the author's decisions, what was checked and what was not.

## Parallel work

- One task per worktree: `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/my-<n>-<slug> -b my-<n>-<slug> main`,
  then `npm ci` inside. In Claude Code, enter it with `EnterWorktree` (`path`).
- Run at most three tasks at a time: three when that many are unblocked and touch different
  files, otherwise two, one for a repo-wide task. The issue's «Порядок» section says what runs
  alongside it (its «Параллельно с…» line and "blocked by" relations). Two tasks that edit the
  same partial, stylesheet or `main.js` never run together.
- The files both tasks will still touch (usually `ai/map.md`, `ai/decisions/README.md`,
  `scripts/main.js`, `styles/style.css`) are named up front in the brief of each, so the branch
  merged later expects the conflict.
- A batch is run by the orchestrator (`ai/prompts/orchestrator.md`).
- Merge one branch at a time; every branch merged after the first rebases onto the updated
  `main` before its merge.
- Repo-wide changes (build config, moving the sources, linter or CI setup) run alone, never
  alongside other branches.
